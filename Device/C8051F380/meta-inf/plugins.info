 This file can list directories where to load plugins from or
# declare virtual plugins.
# Any line that says: pluginDirectory=RELATIVE/PATH/
# will cause appbuilder to read in that directory for plugin subdirectories.
#
# Virtual plugins are declared with sections:
# plugin(xxx) {
#   BLOCK IDENTICAL TO plugin.properties
# }


#pluginDirectory=../plugins/
