13-bit Timer0 External Input Example

This example program uses Timer0 in 13-bit counter mode to blink
LED05. The external signal is generated by a simple busy loop that
is made available on P0.1.

To enable, shorting blocks need to be placed between P0.0/1 and
P0.2/3. Once shorted, the user should press and hold BTN03 to enable
the signal capture.
