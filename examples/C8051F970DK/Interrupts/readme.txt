External Interrupts Example

This example project uses the User Buttons to demonstrate External
Interrupts by turning on and off LEDs.

The user can turn on and off LED05 and LED15 by pressing BTN03 and
BTN04. LED05 will not necessarily correspond to the button state
since mechanical switches tend to 'bounce'. LED15 is set up to
continuously toggle until the button is released.
